Those are my dotfiles
A part of them are synced by MEGA
So here are the missing files that matters to my rice :


* ~/.icons
* ~/.themes


And few other files

Also this is a WIP. The most notable thing about this rice is that my configs automatically detect which pc they are running on and will load the configs accordingly.

# Todo

zsh fish like autocompletion, history & highlight
